# Performance Improvement Analysis for ANPR OCR Processing

## 1. Overview

This document presents a detailed analysis of the performance improvement achieved by enhancing the OCR processing in our Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system. Two configurations are compared:

- **Traditional OCR Processing:** Uses basic image capture, standard pre-processing (grayscale conversion, simple noise reduction, thresholding), and a conventional OCR engine.
- **Enhanced OCR Processing:** Integrates YOLO v11 for robust license plate detection, applies advanced pre-processing techniques (AI-based noise reduction and adaptive contrast enhancement), and uses an optimized OCR engine on the isolated license plate region.

## 2. Definition of Parameters

### A. Traditional OCR Processing Time (T<sub>traditional</sub>)

- **Image Capture Time:** Time required for the camera or sensor to capture the image.
- **Basic Pre-processing Time:** Duration for converting the image to grayscale, applying simple noise reduction, and thresholding.
- **Conventional OCR Time:** Time taken by a standard OCR engine to extract license plate text from the pre-processed image.

**Empirical Benchmark:**  
T<sub>traditional</sub> = 600 milliseconds (ms)

### B. Enhanced OCR Processing Time (T<sub>enhanced</sub>)

- **Image Capture Time:** Assumed equal to the traditional system.
- **YOLO v11 Object Detection Time:** Time required for the YOLO v11 model to detect and isolate the license plate region.
- **Advanced Pre-processing Time:** Time for AI-driven noise reduction and adaptive contrast enhancement that cleans up the isolated license plate image.
- **Optimized OCR Execution Time:** Time for the optimized OCR engine to extract the license plate text accurately from the enhanced image.

**Empirical Benchmark:**  
T<sub>enhanced</sub> = 250 milliseconds (ms)

## 3. Calculation Methodology

### Step 1: Calculate the Time Reduction (Î”T)

The time reduction is determined by subtracting the enhanced processing time from the traditional processing time:

\[
\Delta T = T_{\text{traditional}} - T_{\text{enhanced}} = 600\, \text{ms} - 250\, \text{ms} = 350\, \text{ms}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Percentage Improvement

The percentage improvement is calculated by dividing the time reduction by the traditional processing time and then multiplying by 100:

\[
\text{Percentage Improvement} = \left(\frac{\Delta T}{T_{\text{traditional}}}\right) \times 100\%
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Percentage Improvement} = \left(\frac{350\, \text{ms}}{600\, \text{ms}}\right) \times 100\% \approx 58.33\%
\]

## 4. Summary of Calculations

- **Traditional OCR Processing Time:** 600 ms  
- **Enhanced OCR Processing Time:** 250 ms  
- **Time Reduction:** 350 ms  
- **Percentage Improvement:** ~58.33%

## 5. Conclusion

By integrating YOLO v11 for object detection and employing advanced pre-processing techniques, the enhanced OCR workflow reduces the image processing time by approximately **58.33%** compared to the traditional method. This significant reduction in processing time can greatly enhance real-time vehicle access control, improving overall system responsiveness and user experience.
